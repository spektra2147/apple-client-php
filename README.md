## How to remove Apple Signed Application Account

Please make sure you have the following information to use the library.

- key_path : Key file "xxxxx.p8" given to you by Apple
- teamID(App ID Prefix) : You can find it in the information you created in the App ID field on the Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles screen.
- clientID (Bundle ID or Client ID or Services ID Ex: com.mapilio.main) : You can find it in the information you created in the App ID field on the Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles screen. 
- keyID : The key ID generated with your xxxx.p8 file. It is located in the file name with the extension xxx.p8, which you have received from your Apple account.


### Create a Private Key (xxx.p8 file and key ID) for Client Authentication

Rather than using simple strings as OAuth client secrets, Apple has decided to use a public/private key pair, where the client secret is actually a signed JWT. This next step involves registering a new private key with Apple.

1. Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles screen, choose Keys from the side navigation.
2. Click the blue plus icon to register a new key. Give your key a name, and check the Sign In with Apple checkbox.
3. Click the Configure button and select your primary App ID you created earlier.
4. Apple will generate a new private key for you and let you download it only once. Make sure you save this file, because you wonâ€™t be able to get it back again later! The file you download will end in .p8


### This library provides the following services.

- Generate Client Secret
- Auth
- Revoke



You can review this example usage

      $appleClient = new \VedatAkdogan\AppleClient\AuthApple('xxxxxxxx.p8','XXXXXXXXXX','com.mapilio.main','XXXXXXXXXX');
      $remove_apple_account = $appleClient->revoke($request->auth_code);
